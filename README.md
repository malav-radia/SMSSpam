#SMS Spam Classification Model
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). Leveraging a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning algorithms, the model aims to provide accurate and efficient spam detection.

#Features
Dataset: A curated dataset of labeled SMS messages, including both spam and legitimate messages.
Preprocessing: Techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization are employed to clean and prepare the text data.
Modeling: Various machine learning algorithms are implemented and compared, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Instructions for deploying the model in a production environment are included, along with a simple web interface for testing.
Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow the instructions in the README to set up your environment and run the model on your own data.
