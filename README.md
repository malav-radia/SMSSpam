**SMS Spam Classification Model**
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). Leveraging a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning algorithms, the model aims to provide accurate and efficient spam detection.

**Features**

*Dataset:* A curated dataset of labeled SMS messages, including both spam and legitimate messages.

*Preprocessing:* Techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization are employed to clean and prepare the text data.

*Modeling:* Various machine learning algorithms are implemented and compared, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and many more.

*Evaluation:* The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and precision.

*Prediction:* Instructions for predicting the model in a production environment are done in an python environment.
